# Conclusion

This analysis used LCA public disclosures (2019–2024) to provide an in-depth look at H-1B and related work-visa applications along geographical, occupational, temporal, and employer lines, as well as process outcomes. Throughout the analysis a lot of common threads can be observed. First, approval is the dominant outcome at the LCA stage: certified (or certified-withdrawn) cases outnumber denials and withdrawals by roughly nine to one. The sharp increase in filings in FY 2021 stands out against otherwise stable volumes and is consistent with a post-pandemic hiring rebound and procedural changes, while approval rates remain high.

Location is a second key dimension. Approvals and high prevailing wages are concentrated in a small set of tech-intensive regions especially coastal hubs such as California, Washington, New York, Texas, and parts of the Northeast which also host a disproportionate share of high-skill SOC categories in software and data. At the same time, the software-developer certification map shows very high approval rates in almost all states, with only a few pockets of lower rates, suggesting that geography shapes wage levels and filing volumes more than the probability of certification.

Occupational structure matters more than specific job titles. SOC-level wage distributions show that analytical and IT occupations tend to earn higher salaries, but there is substantial within-occupation dispersion and broad overlap across SOCs once outliers are removed. Boxplots and alluvial diagrams indicate differences in wage levels across outcomes, but these do not sharply separate certified from non-certified cases; many non-standard outcomes are certified-withdrawn rather than outright denials. The decision-tree model confirms this pattern: the most important predictors of certification are SOC major group and worksite location, with prevailing wage level playing a secondary role and full-time status contributing very little. Even within subgroups defined by the tree, predicted certification probabilities remain high.

The application process itself is highly skewed and hierarchical. For software-developer roles, flows from job title to wage level to status show that a small number of common titles and mid-range wage levels account for most cases, and most of these proceed smoothly to certification, with only a minority diverted into withdrawal or denial. Data-quality checks indicate that core variables like case status, SOC codes and titles, wages, and locations are largely complete, with missingness concentrated in secondary fields such as upper wage bounds and some prevailing-wage metadata. However, LCAs capture only one step in a multi-stage visa process, wages are reported in heterogeneous units, and the observational nature of the data precludes causal claims about what drives certification.

Overall, the findings suggest that LCA outcomes at the DOL stage are shaped more by structural factors such as occupation mix, geography, and broad wage tiers than by fine-grained differences in job title or full-time status, and that the main variation lies in where and for which occupations employers file large numbers of applications rather than in whether those applications are approved. These patterns provide a baseline for future work, including CBSA-level analyses, measures of employer concentration, and richer models that incorporate additional wage and occupational detail.
